# Tris Game in Console

Welcome to the **Tris Game in Console** project! ðŸŽ®

This is a simple and funny recreational project (made during my first Java course ðŸ¥²) that allows you to play Tris (also known as Tic-Tac-Toe) directly in your terminal with a friend.

## Requirements

Before you can build and run the game, make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

1. **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Ensure that you have JDK installed (preferably JDK 8 or above).
2. **Apache Maven** - Make sure Maven is installed and properly configured in your system's environment variables.

## Building the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the root folder of the project where the pom.xml file is located.

3. Compile the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn compile
```

## Running the Game

After compiling the project, you can run the game using the following command:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="Main"
```

This will launch the Tris game in your terminal and you can start playing against a friend. Enjoy!
